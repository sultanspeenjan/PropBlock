**PropBlock is a University project made for UOWD that had scored the first place of all projects.** The project's target is to enable the buying and selling Real Estate properties on the Etherum network using Soldity smart contracts. The platform offers authentication via connecting the wallet only (one step closer to Web3.0 world) using the Moralis that acts as that Database.

## Features

- Signup/Login for the customers (whether buyer or seller)
- Responsive web application (for the most part at least)
- Viewing the properties in an asynchronous matter with heafty amount of filters to use
- Buying and selling the properties on the chain itself
- Purchase requests that comes in before being able to issue the agreements
- Agreement system between the buyer and seller as well as having the goverment account as a middleman between the two
- User management page for the goverment account
- All documents & images are uploaded via _IPFS_ to achieve full decentralization (the whole purpose of this project)

## Tech

PropBlock uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - for the front-end
- [ExpressJS] - for the backend-REST API
- [Soldity] - to write smart contracts in
- [Alchemy & Redhat] - to deploy the smart contracts on the network
- [Moralis] - for capturing the events emitted by the contract (on-chain data) and storing the users table (off-chain data)

### My part in completing the project:
I have been the senior lead of this project by combining all the parts, integrating them, unit test and version control the whole project. However, the fair split of my work is stated as below
- **API**: Taking the full responsiblity as a sole member in developing and testing the RESTful API requests & integrate it with the front-end.
- **Smart Contract**: Taking part in helping with the logical thinking of the contract as well as doing some bits here and there that is fully lead by by collegue [@Sultan](https://github.com/sultanspeenjan)
- **Front End**: Solely fully developed some major pages/components in the website. Unit tested and integrated the whole project as well as making sure everything is styled properly.
