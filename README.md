**PropBlock is a University project made for UOWD that had scored the first place of all projects.** The project's target is to enable the buying and selling Real Estate properties on the Etherum network using Soldity smart contracts. The platform offers authentication via connecting the wallet only (one step closer to Web3.0 world) using the Moralis that acts as that Database.

## Features

- Signup/Login for the customers (whether buyer or seller)
- Buying and selling the properties on the chain itself
- Viewing the properties in an asynchronous matter with heafty amount of filters to use
- Purchase requests that comes in before being able to issue the agreements
- Agreement system between the buyer and seller as well as having the goverment account as a middleman between the two
- User management page for the goverment account
- All documents & images are uploaded via _IPFS_ to achieve full decentralization (the whole purpose of this project)
- Responsive web application (for the most part at least)

## Tech

PropBlock uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - for the front-end
- [ExpressJS] - for the backend-REST API
- [Soldity] - to write smart contracts in
- [Alchemy & Redhat] - to deploy the smart contracts on the network
- [Moralis] - for capturing the events emitted by the contract (on-chain data) and storing the users table (off-chain data)

### My part in completing the project:
I have been the senior lead of this project by creating the smart contract for the project, combining all the parts, integrating them, as well as unit testing the project as well. However, the fair split of my work is stated as below:
- **Smart Contract**: Completely developing the smart contract code for the project as well as getting some help in terms of the logical execution of the contract by my collegue [@Ahmed](https://github.com/vaiperboy/)
- **Front End**: Solely fully developed most of the pages/components in the website as well as majority of styling in SCSS, used different libraries to create the UI including Ant Design, WEB3UIKit, etc.
- **UI (Figma)**: Solely developed more than 50 UI's for the project which were later translated to code in the front end.
